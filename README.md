## Project Summary
Designed a browser game where the player must guess the correct color. The player must choose from a set of colors. The correct color is randomly generated. If the player does not select from the set of colors the game will alert them. If the player chooses the wrong color then they will be given a hint. Once the player selects the right color they are notified and the background changes to match the correct color.

### What I learned
The Color Guessing Game was the first time I made a website fully functional for vistors with JavaScript. I wanted it to work correctly on all broswers and mobile devices. Previously, I had made broswer games through JavaScript alerts and prompts. I wanted to eliminate the use of them so it became more user friendly. My challenge was to build a website that would change the text on the page depending on what answer the player submitted, change the background color and have a functional button. To do this I learned how to change the text using innerHTML, crawl the DOM to set a new background gradient and add an Event Listener upon click to start the game.
